# AI-Driven Decision Support System for Water Quality Analysis of River Ganga

## 🏆 Smart India Hackathon 2024 - Problem Statement SIH1694

![Project Banner](https://via.placeholder.com/1200x400?text=Ganga+Water+Quality+DSS)

## 📋 Project Overview

This repository contains the code for our AI-Driven Decision Support System developed during Smart India Hackathon 2024 for analyzing and predicting water quality parameters of the River Ganga. Due to ministerial constraints, the complete code and deployment are currently restricted from public access, but this README provides comprehensive information about the project.

## 🎥 Project Demo

> **Note:** As we cannot publicly share the code or deploy the project due to ministerial constraints, we've included a video demonstration below to showcase the functionality.
